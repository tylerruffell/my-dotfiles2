# Use a loop to print the names of all the files in the current
# directory that have been modified on the same day of the month
# as the current day of the month.  For example, if today is
# the 28th of September and there are three files in the
# current directory (file1 - modified 28th of September,
# file2 - modified 28th of July, file3 modified 3rd of August)
# then your script should print file1 and file2 but not file3.
